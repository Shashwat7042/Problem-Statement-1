A school has 5 classes and each class can have 50 students max, each class teacher records 4 attributes for each student of their class  - Name, Age, Height and percentage.

You need to create a program which allows the possibility to sort the students on basis of these 4 attributes for a particular class.

 

There are some special criteria though:

Class A has 50-50 ratio of boys and girls
In Class B, only girls are allotted
In Class C, only boys are allotted
In Class D, the ratio of girls to boys is 70-30
In Class E, there is no fixed ratio
 

Input:

The data for each class
Class number, and attribute on basis of which data is to be sorted
 

Output:

The sorted list of students in the selected class as per the attribute selected
 

Data to be validated:

1.Incorrect data for the class and students
2.Wrong ratio of boys to girls in class
3.Wrong number of students in the class
4.Incorrect Class number
5.Incorrect attribute
